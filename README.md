# Double-Effect-Evaporation-Simulation
This repository presents a simulation of a double-effect evaporator system for concentrating solutions. The model showcases an energy-efficient process where vapor from the first evaporator heats the second, reducing energy use. Results analyze concentration dynamics, highlighting an inverse response and its impact on control and optimization.

## Simulation Scenario

Non-volatile solutes (e.g., sugar, salt) dissolved in a volatile solvent (e.g., water) are concentrated by heating.

In a multi-effect evaporation system, vapor from the first evaporator is condensed, and its latent heat is used to heat the next evaporator, operating at lower temperature and pressure.

Input: Sucrose solution in water with 30% mass concentration, flow rate of 50 kg/h.

System: Two evaporators operating at low pressure to reduce boiling temperature.

Process: After the first evaporator, the solution reaches ~60% concentration. It is then transferred to the second evaporator, where it is further heated and vapor is separated, achieving a final sucrose concentration of 85%.
