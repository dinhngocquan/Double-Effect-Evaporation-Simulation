# Double-Effect-Evaporation-Simulation
This repository presents a simulation of a double-effect evaporator system for concentrating solutions. The model showcases an energy-efficient process where vapor from the first evaporator heats the second, reducing energy use. Results analyze concentration dynamics, highlighting an inverse response and its impact on control and optimization.
